      <p align="left">This Discord bot is designed to help junior web developers prepare for job interviews. This bot offers practice questions and coding challenges that are commonly found in real-world interviews. You can request questions or tasks with prompts such as "React" or "Javascript." Optionally, you can also specify the difficulty level between 1 and 10 with a number (example: javascript 7). To get the answer to the previous question along with an explanation and links to documentation, simply type "answer". This bot functions by using the GPT-3.5-Turbo-0613 API.
